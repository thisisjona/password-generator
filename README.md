# Password Generator

## Description

This application will allow a user to generate a password from randomly selected characters.
The user will be prompted to choose which type of characters they'd like to include in their password.
This application will allow a user to produce a strong password that will match their criteria.
As a developer, my JavaScript prowess was exercised with the use of if statements, and for loops.
